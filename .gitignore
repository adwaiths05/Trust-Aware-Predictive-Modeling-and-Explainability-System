# Ignore the data folder content? 
# (Usually yes for large CSVs, unless you want sample data in repo)
# If you want to keep the folder but ignore files inside, use this:
data/*
!data/.gitkeep

# Ignore trained models (large binary files)
# If your models are huge (>100MB), Git will reject them.
models/*
!models/.gitkeep

# Streamlit config (if you have secrets)
